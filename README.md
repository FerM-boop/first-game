# first-game
~~This is my first game other than the console python and js super beginner projects with no actual animation.~~
\nThis was initially a repo for just the first game ("Hungry Joe") but I'm planning on building it out to a full mini-game website
adding on more games with different frameworks / libraries to make it into a more long term project and learn along side it. 

## Hungry Joe 
\nBuilt using Phaser, a JavaScript framework. Following this tutorial: https://www.lessmilk.com/phaser-game-tutorial/
\nJoe is a 2d character that is SUPER hungry for croissants, BUT... theres some bombs in the way. Moves with arrow keys.

## Snake Game
~~I am now adding a snake game. Following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgSjVMmkLC0&ab_channel=JeffAporta~~
\nI ended up not using that tutorial, the game is pure javascript, no libs.
\nClassic snake game, self explanatory. Moves with arrow keys.
