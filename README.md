# first-game
This is my first game other than the console python and js super beginner projects with no actual animation.

I will be using Phaser, a JavaScript framework.

Following this tutorial: https://www.lessmilk.com/phaser-game-tutorial/

I already finished the tutorial, I will continue adding more stuff to practice, thinking of adding more games to the website itself too.
